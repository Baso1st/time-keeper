## Welcome to Time Keeper Automation.

**This project is built to automate the weekly task of adding my hours to time keeper.**

The project is built using Cypress.io

**Note:** You need to add a file named cypress.env.json to the root of the project. The file should have the required credentials for the okta authentication test
